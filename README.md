## Infrastructure Engineer | U.S. Navy Veteran

Building reliable, scalable infrastructure systems with a strong bias towards action and ownership. I consider well-maintained documentation to be a feature, not a bug.

My focus is on end-to-end platform architecture and SRE practices across various environments:

▪️Multi-Namespace Kubernetes architected for Hybrid Cloud and bare-metal deployments.

▪️Zero-trust security architectures with comprehensive RBAC and service mesh (Istio) integration.

▪️Full-stack observability and monitoring solutions (Prometheus, Grafana).

▪️Full CI/CD pipeline via Go -> Docker image -> GitHub actions pipeline -> GCP artifact repo.

## Core Tech Stack

▪️Cloud-Native: Kubernetes, Docker, GCP

▪️Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible

▪️Systems/Virtualization: Linux (RHEL, Ubuntu), Networking, ProxMox, VMWare, KVM

▪️Monitoring/SRE:Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, Dynatrace

▪️Automation/Scripting: Bash, Go, YAML, GitHub Actions, Powershell

## Portfolio & Collaboration

This portfolio showcases the systematic implementation of complex infrastructure with thorough documentation and real-world production experience.

Proof of Concept: See the complete GCP/ProxMox Hybrid Cloud Kubernetes demonstration on my LinkedIn profile.

Always interested in collaborating with other infrastructure engineers and contributing to open-source projects.
