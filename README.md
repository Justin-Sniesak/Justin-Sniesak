## Site Reliability Engineer building tools for production reliability and observability.

I keep production systems running and automate everything that breaks more than once. Currently focused on cloud-native SRE: Kubernetes troubleshooting, Go-based automation tools, and observability platforms (Prometheus, DataDog, OpenTelemetry).
What you'll find here:

Production-grade Kubernetes labs with full observability stacks
Hybrid cloud infrastructure (AWS/on-prem) with site-to-site VPN
Go CI/CD pipelines and automation tools
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
Documented troubleshooting and incident response procedures

All projects follow SRE best practices: IaC, monitoring, runbooks, and comprehensive documentation.
