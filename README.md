Infrastructure Engineer

This portfolio showcases my Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure work. I focus on systematic implementation of complex systems with thorough documentation.

My projects demonstrate hands-on experience with:

- Cloud-Native: Kubernetes, Docker, GCP

- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible

- Systems: Linux (RHEL, Ubuntu, Alpine), Networking, Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, Dynatrace

- Automation and Programmability: Bash, Go, YAML

Always interested in connecting with other infrastructure engineers.
