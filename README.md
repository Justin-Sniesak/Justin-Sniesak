## Site Reliability Engineer | Navy Vet | Cloud-Native Platforms | IaC | Kubernetes | Automation 

Building production-grade, self-healing, observable systems with Kubernetes, Terraform, Go, and GitHub Actions. Experienced in multi-cloud (GCP + AWS) and hybrid on-prem environments, designing platforms that scale, automate repetitive tasks, and reduce operational toil.

My projects span:

- Cloud-Native SRE Platforms with automated Prometheus observability and multi-tenant Kubernetes environments

- Go-based CI/CD pipelines for containerized workloads and registry orchestration

- Hybrid Cloud Integrations with AWS, ProxMox, and DataDog observability migrations

- Portfolio Automation pipelines using GitHub Actions & Jekyll

I thrive on root cause analysis, observability design, and eliminating manual toil—if a process needs human intervention twice, it’s getting automated.
