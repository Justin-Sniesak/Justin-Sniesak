Infrastructure Engineer
This portfolio showcases my Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure work. I focus on systematic implementation of complex systems with thorough documentation.
My projects demonstrate hands-on experience with:

Cloud-Native: Kubernetes, Docker, GCP, Go
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible
Systems: Linux, Networking, Prometheus, Grafana

Always interested in connecting with other infrastructure engineers.
