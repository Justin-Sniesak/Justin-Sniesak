## Site Reliability Engineer | Navy Vet | Cloud-Native Platforms | IaC | Kubernetes | Automation

Building production-grade, self-healing, observable systems with **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, **Go**, and **GitHub Actions**. Experienced in multi-cloud (GCP + AWS) and hybrid on-prem environments, designing platforms that scale, automate repetitive tasks, and eliminate operational toil.

**Highlighted Projects:**

- **Cloud-Native SRE Platforms** – Automated Prometheus observability and multi-tenant Kubernetes environments  
- **Go CI/CD Pipelines** – Containerized builds, registry authentication, and deployment orchestration  
- **Hybrid Cloud Integrations** – AWS + ProxMox environments with unified DataDog observability  
- **Portfolio Automation** – GitHub Actions + Jekyll pipelines for continuous documentation deployment  

I thrive on **root cause analysis, observability design, and removing manual toil**—if a process needs human intervention twice, it gets automated.
