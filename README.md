## ⚙️ Featured Projects

### 🧠 Platform Engineering Lab  
Stack: Kubernetes (Minikube), Terraform, Prometheus, GCP, ProxMox   
Built multi-namespace Kubernetes environment in Minikube on bare-metal Ubuntu, integrated with GCP and ProxMox for hybrid operations. Implemented Istio, RBAC, and Zero-Trust controls with full observability.
⏱️ Terraform cut provisioning from 6 h → 5 m | 📊 MTTR reduced ~50% | 🧾 Fully documented ops logs
