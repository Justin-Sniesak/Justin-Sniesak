## Infrastructure Engineer – Site Reliability and Platform Engineering | Navy Vet | Cloud-Native Platforms | IaC | Kubernetes | Automation  

I fix broken infrastructure and automate everything so no one gets woken up twice for the same issue — then I document the fix so it never happens again. 10+ years keeping distributed systems alive: managing 5,000+ Linux servers, building Kubernetes platforms, and removing operational toil one script at a time. Navy veteran in Seattle, obsessed with automation and accurate documentation.  

I learn fast, solve what others avoid, and can write or troubleshoot Kubernetes manifests all day without blinking. Recently built a hybrid-cloud S2S VPN in 13 hours — first time — because I like hard problems and hate downtime.

### **Highlighted Projects**
- **Cloud-Native SRE Platforms** – Automated Prometheus observability and multi-tenant Kubernetes environments  
- **Go CI/CD Pipelines** – Containerized builds, registry authentication, and deployment orchestration  
- **Hybrid Cloud Integrations** – AWS + GCP + ProxMox environments unified through DataDog observability  
- **Platform Engineering Lab** – Terraform-driven hybrid cloud with Kubernetes, WireGuard VPN, and IaC automation  
- **Portfolio Automation** – GitHub Actions + Jekyll pipelines for continuous documentation deployment

I thrive on root-cause analysis, observability design, and eliminating manual toil.  
If your monitoring stack is held together with duct tape and optimism, I’ll fix it.

  <summary>🧭 <b>Full Roadmap: 2025–2026 Platform Engineering Lab</b></summary>

**Phase 1: CI/CD Expansion & Go Mastery**  
- Complete Go Beginner/Intermediate & Advanced courses (KodeKloud).  
- Dockerize new Go applications and connect pipelines to GCP Artifact Registry.  
- Deploy and validate GKE clusters with ArgoCD for continuous delivery.  
- Implement Pub/Sub + Secrets Manager for API key rotation and alerts.  

**Phase 2: Hybrid Cloud Expansion**  
- Extend Terraform manifests to connect GCP → ProxMox via WireGuard S2S VPN.  
- Provision Talos on-prem clusters and enable full region redundancy.  
- Integrate Prometheus + Grafana dashboards across both clusters.  

**Phase 3: Advanced Observability & FinOps**  
- Complete Prometheus Certified Associate and OpenTelemetry courses.  
- Deploy OTel collectors, Loki, and OpenCost for tracing, logging, and cost analytics.  
- Build unified dashboards covering latency, uptime, CPU/mem/disk, and FinOps metrics.  

**Phase 4: MLOps & Intelligent Automation**  
- Deploy TensorFlow CIFAR training workloads on GKE (GPU-enabled).  
- Integrate Terraform Cloud, Crossplane, and Backstage for advanced orchestration.  
- Build self-healing pipelines and AI-assisted drift detection utilities in Go.
