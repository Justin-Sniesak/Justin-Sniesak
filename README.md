## Infrastructure Engineer - Site Reliability and Platform Engineering focus | Navy Vet | Cloud-Native Platforms | IaC | Kubernetes | Automation

I fix broken infrastructure and automate all the things so you don't have to wake me up at 3am twice for the same thing - then I'll give you a new runbook anyone can follow for what I fixed the following workday. 10+ years keeping distributed systems alive—managed 5,000+ server fleets, built Kubernetes platforms, and eliminated operational toil one script at a time. Navy veteran in Seattle who automates any manual processes I can get approval for, and will fix all of your incomplete and missing documentation.

I learn inhumanly fast, and I can write and troubleshoot Kubernetes manifests all day and never get bored. If your infrastructure has less stability than a Michigan winter, and you are running with a monitoring stack held together with thoughts and prayers, I'm your engineer. Recently architected and deployed a hybrid cloud S2S VPN in 13 hours never having done it before because I love technical challenges that I can grow from, staying busy, and helping the team win.

**Highlighted Projects:**

- **Cloud-Native SRE Platforms** – Automated Prometheus observability and multi-tenant Kubernetes environments  
- **Go CI/CD Pipelines** – Containerized builds, registry authentication, and deployment orchestration  
- **Hybrid Cloud Integrations** – AWS + ProxMox environments with unified DataDog observability  
- **Portfolio Automation** – GitHub Actions + Jekyll pipelines for continuous documentation deployment  

I thrive on **root cause analysis, observability design, and removing manual toil**—if a process needs human intervention twice, it gets automated.
