## Senior Infrastructure Engineer | U.S. Navy Veteran

Building reliable, scalable infrastructure systems with a strong bias towards action and ownership. I consider well-maintained documentation to be a feature, not a bug.

## What I Build:

▪️ Resilient Kubernetes clusters architected for Hybrid Cloud and bare-metal environments

▪️ Zero-trust security architectures with comprehensive RBAC and service mesh (Istio) integration

▪️ Full-stack observability and monitoring solutions (Prometheus)

## Tech Stack:

▪️ Cloud-Native: Kubernetes, Docker, GCP

▪️ Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible

▪️ Systems: Linux (RHEL, Ubuntu, Alpine), Networking, ProxMox, VMWare, KVM

▪️ Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, Dynatrace

▪️ Automation: Bash, Go, YAML, GitHub Actions

This portfolio demonstrates systematic implementation of complex infrastructure with thorough documentation and real-world production experience.

## Proof of Concept

Always interested in collaborating with other infrastructure engineers and contributing to open source projects.
